MasonX/ApacheHandler/WithCallbacks version 0.91
===============================================

MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks subclasses HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler in
order to provide callbacks. Callbacks are code references provided to the
new() constructor, and are triggered either for every request or by specially
named keys in the Mason request arguments. The callbacks are executed at the
beginning of a request, just before Mason creates and executes the request
component stack.

The idea is to configure Mason to execute arbitrary code before executing any
components. Doing so allows you to carry out logical processing of data
submitted from a form, to affect the contents of the Mason request arguments
(and thus the %ARGS hash in components), and even to redirect or abort the
request before Mason handles it.
