MasonX/ApacheHandler/WithCallbacks version 1.00
===============================================

MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks subclasses HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler in
order to provide a Mason callback system. Callbacks may be either code
references provided to the new() constructor, or methods defined in subclasses
of MasonX::CallbackHandler. Callbacks are triggered either for every request
or by specially named keys in the Mason request arguments, and all callbacks
are executed at the beginning of a request, just before Mason creates and
executes the request component stack.

The idea behind this module is to provide a sort of plugin architecture for
Mason. Mason then executes code before executing any components. This approach
allows you to carry out logical processing of data submitted from a form, to
affect the contents of the Mason request arguments (and thus the %ARGS hash in
components), and even to redirect or abort the request before Mason handles
it.
